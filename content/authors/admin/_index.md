Ridwan Jaafar is a tropical ecologist with a strong academic background and deep passion for global biodiversity and ecosystems conservation. Currently, He is in the final year of a joint Master in Tropical Biodiversity and Ecosystems (TROPIMUNDO) at the Université libre de Bruxelles and Vrije Universiteit Brussel under the excellence-labelled Erasmus Mundus programme. I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Applied Ecology from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Nigeria.

Ridwan was trained by internationally reputable conservation institutions including the UK-based Tropical Biology Association in Botswana; A.P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute and the Nigerian Montane Forest Project in Nigeria, where he was exposed to field research and developed hands-on practical skillsets while working alongside expert scientists in broad areas of ecology and conservation science. His experiences have led to a range of interests, centered around plant-animal interactions (mainly fruvigory and seed dispersal), restoration ecology and ecological stoichiometry. 

Over the years, Ridwan has proven a demonstrable commitment to this chosen career path evidenced by competencies he has sharpened in both volunteer and trainee roles within Africa and Malaysia. Ridwan has been part of various research projects on broad aspects of tropical ecology, and more recently, he is now working on an MSc project to understand processes and mechanisms driving dung stoichiometry patterns of wild mammalian herbivores across African savannas.
